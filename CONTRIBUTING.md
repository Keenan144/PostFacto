# Development Environment

## Dependencies

* Ruby 2.4.0
* bundler
* rspec
* Node 6
* npm 3.10.10 (`npm install -g npm@3.10.10`)
* gulp
* chromedriver

To avoid having to install and manage these dependencies you can use the Postfacto [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/postfacto/postfacto/) for development.

## Installing library dependencies

Before development you'll need to install library dependencies (gems and npm packages) for the `web`, `api` and `e2e` codebases by running:

```bash
./deps.sh
```

## Running locally

You can run Postfacto locally at [http://localhost:3000]() by running:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The admin dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:4000/admin](). You can create an admin user using the following rake task in the `api` directory:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=email@example.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=password rake admin:create_user
```

## Running tests

You can run the tests for the whole project in the root directory by simply running:

```bash
./test.sh
```

### Web

```bash
cd web
gulp spec-app
```

### API

```bash
cd api
bundle exec rake
```

### End to end

```bash
cd web
gulp local-acceptance
```
